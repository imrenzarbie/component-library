# Benco Component Library POC

This is a proof-of-concept project to create a Component Library for Benco developers, serving as both a design guide and a source of ready-to-use components.


This project would be a collection of reusable React components designed to accelerate UI development and ensure design consistency. It leverages Storybook for interactive documentation, enabling easy exploration and testing of each component in isolation.
